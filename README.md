## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Construction Project Managers face significant challenges in monitoring daily project activities:

- **Reactive Decision Making**: PMs often react to situations without consulting historical best practices, leading to cost overruns across multiple projects
- **Information Overload**: Manual review of multiple daily logs (manpower, equipment, inspection, weather, construction reports) is time-consuming and error-prone
- **Missed Risk Indicators**: Critical patterns and early warning signs buried in daily operational data
- **Knowledge Silos**: Best practices and lessons learned not readily accessible during decision-making moments
- **Delayed Response**: Issues identified after they've already impacted schedule and budget

### Business Impact
- Unplanned cost overruns due to reactive decision-making
- Schedule delays from missed early warning signs
- Inconsistent application of organizational best practices
- Reduced project profitability and client satisfaction
